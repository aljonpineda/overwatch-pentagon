# overwatch-pentagon
Overwatch Pentagon relies on the OWAPI (https://github.com/Fuyukai/OWAPI) to retrieve player play time statistics and display a pentagon that describes their overall playstyle. The pentagon shows a proportion of how much time a player plays in each role.

Currently, the OWAPI returns no data, so Overwatch Pentagon is unable to display player statistics.
